## INTRODUCTION - System stability 
* System stability is one of the most important performance specification of a control system. 
* A system is considered unstable if it does not return to its initial position but continues to oscillate after it is subjected to any change in input or is subjected to undesirable disturbance.
* A stable system is designed so as to get the desired response of the system without any intolerable variation with the changes in the system parameters.
* Generally, a system is said to be stable when the poles of the transfer function of the system are located on the left side of the s-plane.
* Routh-Hurwitz Stability Criterion offers an easy method of predicting the systemâ€™s stability without completely solving the characteristic equation.

## RESEARCH


## COST AND FEATURES 



## DEFINING SYSTEM 
* input the characteristic equation from user
* menu contains following: display steps, answer directly, description which case 

## SWOT ANALYSIS 

![provides ease of determining the relative stability of the system  time to calculate determinants is saved by the Routh-Hurwitz criterion  the system is unstable then we can easily get the number of roots of the char](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68493803/114508380-e8fb4f00-9c51-11eb-9ca1-80b9a87a9bd0.png)
