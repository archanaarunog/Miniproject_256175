# ROUTH-HURWITZ STABILITY CRITERION 

* The Routhâ€“Hurwitz stability criterion is a mathematical test that is a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of a linear time invariant (LTI) control system
* The criterion provides an analytical means for testing the stability of a linear system of any order without having to obtain the roots of the characteristic equation
* The user inputs the characterisitic equation of a closed loop and the output displays whether the given system is stable or not by checking the criteria
